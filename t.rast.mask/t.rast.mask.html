<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>t.rast.mask</em> applies one strds as a mask to another strds. By 
default, all cells in the input strds are set to <em>mask_value</em> 
where the mask strds is NULL or zero. This behaviour can be inverted 
with the <em>-i</em> flag, such that all cells in the input strds set 
to <em>mask_value</em> where the mask strds is not NULL and not zero.

<p>
Any semantic labels in the input strds are transferred to the output strds.

<p>
This module expects several parameters. The resulting space time raster 
dataset must be specified in the <b>output</b> option together with the 
<b>basename</b> of generated raster maps that are registered in the 
resulting STRDS. Empty maps resulting from map-calculation are not 
registered by default. This behavior can be changed with the <b>-n</b> 
flag. The flag <b>-s</b> can be used to assure that only spatially 
related maps in the STRDS's are processed. Spatially related means that 
temporaly related maps overlap in their spatial extent.
