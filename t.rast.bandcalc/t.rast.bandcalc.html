<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>t.rast.bandcalc</em> performs a spatio-temporal
<em>mapcalc</em> expression on maps of temporally sampled space time
raster datasets (STRDS). It uses a single STRDS as input and calculates 
a new STRDS according to <em>expression</em> from different bands 
included in the input STRDS. This is useful to e.g. calculcate a 
time-series of NDVI or EVI maps, or any other indices based on 
several different input bands.

<p>
This module is a front-end for 
<em><a href="t.rast.mapcalc.html">t.rast.mapcalc</a></em>.

<p>
Different bands must be referenced in the expression by 
<em>data[index]</em> with index being a number starting with 0. For 
example, with Sentinel-2, <em>data[3]</em> refers to the fourth 
Sentinel-2 band &quot;S2_4 Visible (Red)&quot;. 
<em>t.rast.bandcalc</em> replaces <em>data[index]</em> with the 
according selections of the input STRDS.

<p>
This module expects several parameters. The resulting space time raster 
dataset must be specified in the <b>output</b> option together with the 
<b>basename</b> of generated raster maps that are registered in the 
resulting STRDS. Empty maps resulting from map-calculation are not 
registered by default. This behavior can be changed with the <b>-n</b> 
flag. The flag <b>-s</b> can be used to assure that only spatially 
related maps in the STRDS's are processed. Spatially related means that 
temporaly related maps overlap in their spatial extent.
